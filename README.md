- **min**: The lowest temperature in June was 64 degrees but 56 degrees in December.
- **max**: The highest temperature in June was 85 degrees while December's highest temperature was 83 degrees.

## Summary

While there are significant differences in the lowest temperatures for the month, there is only a three percent difference in the average temperatures for June and December.

### Additional queries

1. An additional query performed was to filter the June and December data sets to a single year. The most recent and complet data set was analyzed, which was the year 2016.

2. To gain a better understanding of the temperature year-round, a query was performed to compare the June and December temperatures to other months in the year. The most recent and complet data set was analyzed, which was the year 2016.
